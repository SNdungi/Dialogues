        <h3>Phase 1: Conception & Proposal Development</h3>
        <p class="instructions">The goal of this phase is to move from a general interest to a specific, arguable, and academically significant research project.</p>

        <div class="task">
            <h4>1.1. Identify the General Field of Study</h4>
            <p>Begin by narrowing your focus to a specific domain.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Patristics (Early Church Fathers), Reformation History, Systematic Theology, Biblical Exegesis (e.g., Pauline Epistles), Political Theology, Feminist Theology, Philosophy of Religion.</p>
            <div class="template-box">
                <strong>My Field:</strong> <code>[e.g., 20th Century Protestant Systematic Theology]</code>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="task">
            <h4>1.2. Establish the State of the Question (*Status Quaestionis*)</h4>
            <p>Conduct a preliminary literature review to understand the existing scholarly conversation. What has already been said? Where are the debates, tensions, or gaps?</p>
            <div class="template-box">
                <strong>Status Quaestionis Summary:</strong>
                <p>Scholar A (<code>[Name of Scholar]</code>) in their work (<code>[Book/Article Title]</code>) argues that <code>[Scholar A's main point]</code>.</p>
                <p>However, Scholar B (<code>[Name of Scholar]</code>) challenges this by positing that <code>[Scholar B's counter-argument]</code>.</p>
                <p>While this debate is well-established, a significant gap exists concerning <code>[The specific gap or unexamined issue]</code>.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="task">
            <h4>1.3. Formulate the Research Question</h4>
            <p>Turn the identified gap into a precise, guiding question.</p>
            <div class="template-box">
                <strong>Research Question:</strong> <code>[e.g., How did Dietrich Bonhoeffer's understanding of 'costly grace' in "The Cost of Discipleship" directly inform his theory of state responsibility in the "Ethics" fragments?]</code>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="task">
            <h4>1.4. Craft the Thesis Statement</h4>
            <p>The thesis is the central, arguable claim that answers your research question. It is the single most important sentence of your entire project.</p>
            <div class="template-box">
                <strong>Thesis Statement:</strong> This study argues that <code>[Your central, arguable claim]</code>. It will demonstrate this by <code>[briefly outlining the main steps of your argument, e.g., 'by first analyzing concept X, then tracing its development in text Y, and finally showing its impact on historical event Z.']</code>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="task">
            <h4>1.5. Define the Methodology and Scope</h4>
            <p>Clearly state the intellectual tools you will use and the boundaries of your research.</p>
            <p class="automation-note"><!-- User selects from a dropdown of methodologies. --></p>
            <div class="template-box">
                <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> This research will employ a <code>[e.g., Historical-Critical Method combined with a Conceptual Analysis]</code> to interpret the primary sources.</p>
                <p><strong>Scope & Delimitations:</strong> This study is limited to <code>[e.g., the published and unpublished writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer between 1937 and 1945]</code>. It will not address <code>[e.g., his earlier universalist tendencies or the reception of his work in post-war America]</code>.</p>

            <h4>2.2. Critical Reading & Note-Taking</h4>

                <li><strong>Clarity & Style:</strong> Is the prose clear, concise, and academic in tone?</li>
                <li><strong>Proofreading:</strong> Check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors. Read it aloud.</li>
