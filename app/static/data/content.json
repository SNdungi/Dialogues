Is not this the carpenter\u2019s son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brethren James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?\u201d And they took offence at him. But Jesus said to them, \u201cA prophet is not without honour except in his own country and in his own house.\u201d And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</p><p></p>",

    "title": "On Theodicy: Reconciling a Good God with a World of Suffering",
    "body": "<p>The discourse on theodicy grapples with one of the most profound challenges to faith: If God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good, why does evil and suffering persist? This is not merely an intellectual puzzle, but a deep, existential question that touches every human life.</p><p>Various approaches have been proposed. The Augustinian theodicy posits that evil is not a 'thing' in itself, but a privation of good (privatio boni), stemming from the misuse of free will by created beings. In contrast, the Irenaean theodicy suggests that the world is a 'vale of soul-making,' where challenges and suffering are necessary for spiritual development and moral growth.</p>",
